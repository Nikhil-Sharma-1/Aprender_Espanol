<h1>Aprender Espa√±ol</h1>
<h2>Created an app which displays lists of vocabulary words (using RECYCLER VIEW) for the user to learn Spanish language. Each element in the list has an image, Spanish word, English translation of the Spanish word and audio for the Spanish word. This app uses OnCompletionListener from MediaPlayer Class which triggers when audio gets completed and the onCompletion method was implemented in a way so that it will free up resources as soon as audio gets completed in order to save memory from android for other apps which are running on the background.</h2>
